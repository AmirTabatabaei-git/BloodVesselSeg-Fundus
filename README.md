# BloodVesselSeg-Fundus
Segmentation of blood vessels in fundus photography images

### Introduction:
In the fourth part of the assignment, we need to perform a method for the segmentation of blood vessels in fundus photography images. Fundus photography is a non-invasive technique used to capture high-resolution images of the retina, which can help in the diagnosis of various eye diseases. Blood vessels in fundus images provide important information about the state of the retina and can help in the detection of diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, glaucoma, and macular degeneration.

### Method:
The following block diagram shows the method we used for segmenting the blood vessels step by step:

### Quantitative Metrics:
The quantitative metrics for evaluating the performance of the method are precision, recall, and F-score. The results for the three images are presented in Table 7.
